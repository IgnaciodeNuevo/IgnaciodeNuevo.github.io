## The project

The many-device web we use today has tought us to design to design in very different ways.

Designing one website for small and large screens could be very tricky. So in the agency I was working for, one of our clients camed with a big problem, they wanted to create a platform where legal professionals such as notaries, lawyers, attorneys and law students in Spain could attend networking events organized by [Grupo Legantia](http://grupolegantia.com), share their knowlage and debate in the forum, read articles published by reputed professionals, post or find a job and also create professional relationships through social network.
