## The project

This is the first project I helped while I was at Martin & Young and one of the easiest in my entire career but at allways you have new challenges when starting a project. I had never used [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.com) to build something so it was the what we used to make [Asesores LowCost](http://www.asesoreslowcost.com/).

We helped one of our best clients (a law firm based in Madrid) to sell one new service.

## The process

When I started working at Martin & Young my boss helped me understanding how WordPress templates works and why we used some plugins at [Asesores LowCost](http://www.asesoreslowcost.com/)'s website like the following:

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/" target="_blank">Contact Form 7</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" target="_blank">W3 Total Cache</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">Google Analytics for WordPress</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/" target="_blank">Google XML Sitemap</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/" target="_blank">Ninja Forms</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/" target="_blank">JetPack</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://es.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/" target="_blank">Yoast SEO</a></li>
</ul>

I know I know, some of them aren't used in this website but others are used in <a href="http://camisetatotal.com/" target="_blank">Camiseta Total</a> which we also mantain for other of our clientes.

Developing a website for online consulting and accounting for freelancers and companies we choose grey and blue as corporate colors. The client knew his clients were middle-age freelancers and small companies, so he chose sober colors to match the look and feel of their main company.

## The tech

As all our projects we used [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) as day to day Git based repository with the help of [SourceTree App](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), we choose [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.com) as our CMS because it was a small informative website so we have never had the necessity to use a bigger one.

We couldn't build this website from scratch due to our deadlines so all our team available and our project manager who also was our boss, Luis Mart√≠n worked together throughout the week to finish the project as quickly as possible.

As mentioned, the platform was built on top of WordPress, which was hosted on [webempresa](http://www.webempresa.com) as every of our projects because they have the best customer service I know.

## Final Thoughts

I would have made the website by making a custom template instead of buying one and modifying the global.css which is not a good practice.

Knowing how to manage some plugins and templates would helped us to build the website faster instead of reading lot of tutorials, but now I know lot of new things about WordPress.
