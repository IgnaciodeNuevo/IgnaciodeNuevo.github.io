## jQuery and APIs

Week five and I have been developing a lot. I feel confortable developing small projects in Rails. We'll see what happends next three weeks...

On monday we had Raúl, one of the Ironhack Teacher Assistants as our instructor. We have been introduced to jQuery and if I'm right the most famous JavaScript library. It is usefull because it helps to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) or as I say, the HTML tree. Because we have been learning only tree days of real JavaScript (we knew lot of basic stuff like variables, functions and so on) so we didn't saw the basics this week.

We learnt what is Ajax:

Web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for web pages, and by extension web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page. Despite the name, the use of XML is not required (JSON is often used in the AJAJ variant), and the requests do not need to be asynchronous.

I.E: imagine you are filling a form and the connection goes down. The browser via local storage has been saving the data, so when you refresh the website your data is still here!

After a long but good day we had the pleasure to meet [Carlos Blé](https://twitter.com/carlosble){:target="_blank"} a recognized Spanish developer from Islas Canarias and software craftsman at [CODESAI](http://www.codesai.com){:target="_blank"}. He talked about extreme programming, which is not programming while doing extreme sports :) Extreme programming (XP) is a software development method to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements, he talked a bit of programming history followed by a brief explanation of the XP values: communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage, principles and practices. In this participative session he discussed what does it mean to be a professional software developer and how to get there.

#### Monday recap

- Javascript in the Browser
- DOM manipulation with jQuery
- Events with jQuery
- Pizza Builder Exercise

Tuesday was completly different. We started learning how to communicate with an API and the problems started.

Communicating with a good API like the Spotify's one was ok but it was the first time I had to do such a thing and it took me hours to find the solution to the problems I had. We have learnt how to use the source tab in the Developer Tools in Chrome and how to debug JavaScript and jQuery using breakpoints or using the setps tool instead of breakpoints.

#### Tuesday recap

- Slides - Ajax
- Spotify Artist Search exercise

On Wednesday I learnt what are the differences between RESTful and Soap APIs, one only gives you information and the other one features, we have also learnt what are Pitfalls in JavaScript and what is Local Storage (but not how to use it).

My classmates also learnt how to use HTML video and audio tags and how to use fallbacks while needed (Notice I say my classmates because I knew it).

The remaining morning we learnt how to use the `this` object in JavaScript, the most confusing thing I have learnt this week so far; and what is hoisting in JavaScript and jQuery. Raúl taught us to use the Google Geolocation API and how to implement it in Google Maps, it was amazing.

Thursday was... bad, I have been sleeping eight ours a day but with no reason I was sleepy all the week, I had this experience of learning nothing because of my drowsiness... awful. Friday was as always a full day exercise. We did a [Spotify Player](https://github.com/IgnaciodeNuevo/Ironhack/blob/master/Week%205/Day%205/spotify-skeleton-master/spotify.js){:target="_blank"} thanks to Spotify's API

#### Thursday and Friday recap
