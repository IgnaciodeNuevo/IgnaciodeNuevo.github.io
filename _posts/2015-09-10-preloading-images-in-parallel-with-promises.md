The single fact that you clicked on that link to come here shows that you are brave. Most people just run away when it comes to regular expressions. They are wrong to do so! Not only are they extremely valuable, but their foundations also are actually quite easy to grasp.

However, regular expressions are hard to read, if not to say barely decipherable. That’s why I thought an article on the basics of regular expressions would not be such a bad idea after all. And to avoid the very theoretical approach, I feel like actually building a regular expression the hard way from the ground up would be a good way to learn.

*Disclaimer!* I am not an expert in regular expressions, although I guess I can make my way in most situations with them, as long as it’s not getting overly complex. If you happen to find a way to improve this code, be kind enough to explain what you would do in the comments. That would be super great. :)
