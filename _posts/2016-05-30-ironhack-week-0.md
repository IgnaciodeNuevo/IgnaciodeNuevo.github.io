Big announcement this week. I decided to apply to a Spanish Bootcamp, [Ironhack](http://www.ironhack.com). During the next 8 Weeks after this very first one we will learn [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org), [JavaScript](http://www.ecmascript.org) which I've started learning a [couple of months ago](2016/02/18/my-next-step-learning-and-new-years-resolutions) but I've stoped learning it due to new projects such as [WeCodeSign](http://wecodesignpodcast.com/) Podcast, my Spanish Podcast about Web Design and Development.

But for now, I'm pretty sure this will be an intensive and pretty amazing jurney. So excited to have such a great experience working really hard every day.

##  Monday

I waked up at 6:30 an traveled one hour and a half from the north of Madrid (Spain) to the offices of the Bootcamp which tooks me at least 2-3h a day going from my home to Ironhack but this is worth it.

I've been there so early that I waited one hour until LLuis the Teacher Assistant comed by, then I've started installing the devevelopment enviroment, XCode, Sublime Text 3, Ruby, Git etc...

I've continued working on the pre-Bootcamp until 6:30pm when I leave.

First day acomplished, so happy but exhausted, will see tomorrow.

## Tuesday

Camed early and continued my pre-work. I decided to start de PRO [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com) as a recommendation to learn Ruby basics (I've spent the las week at home with this task).

I've been doing the Ruby path today and landed in the final project at 5:30. I've started the final project until 7:00 when I leave.

## Wednesday

I was this morning with Ruby, doing exercises while Ra√∫l the Ironhack Lead Teacher told us to skip the last part and start JavaScript. Our teachers couldn't be at Ironhack during Wednesday, Thursday and Friday so Marina a Teacher Assistant stayed with us.

I've started the JavaScript prework learning the basics, variables, loops, arrays, objects and so on.

## Thursday

Today is the day where we should have finished the prework, but I couldn't because it is a 60h work + PRO CodeAcademy JavaScript and Ruby paths but I've been accepted only 9 days ago...

Marina will help us with a JavaScript recap, which should help us to recapitulate what we should have learned so it will be a kind of class to learn the basics of JavaScript. Will see.

## Friday
