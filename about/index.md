# About me

I am Ignacio, a Spanish Front-end Developer focusing on [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), architecture, scalability, front-end performance, and mobile and [responsive web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) based in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid). After a couple of years working in different things, I have rediscovered the front-end after completing a master's degree in [Trazos](http://www.trazos.net/) of [Web Development and Graphic Design](http://www.trazos.net/masters/curso-master-en-diseno-grafico/).

I had the pleasure to have [Eduardo Fierro](http://eduardofierro.pro/) as Web Development teacher, he is the kind of teacher who manages to give the best of you and undoubtedly his greatest virtue, is his ability to motivate the student.

After a year and a half, learning by my self, I had the great opportunity to join [Martin & Young](http://www.martin-young.com/), a small digital agency in Madrid to work on client projects.

This year and a half, I have discovered my greatest passion.

I dare call myself someone who likes learning, I am also constantly tweeting, writing about the web, graphic design and other topics.

So I work harder every day, learning to be up to date.
