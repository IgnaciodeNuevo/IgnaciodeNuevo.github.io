  <p>With one year of experience as a front-end designer in a company, I wanted a change in my life. This is why I decided to enroll at <a href="https://www.ironhack.com" target="_blank">Ironhack</a> to improve my programming skills.</p>

  <p>I also Co-Host a Podcast in Spanish about web design and development called <a href="http://wecodesignpodcast.com">WeCodeSign Podcast</a>.</p>
